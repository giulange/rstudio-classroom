See the minimal example of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). 

The contents inside the .Rmd files provide some pointers to help you get started, but feel free to also delete the content in each file and start fresh.

In case of issues with compiling `Error: path for html_dependency not found:`, try the following:

 - restart R Session `.rs.restartR()`
